### Backend Engineer 

Hi, I'm a Python-focused backend engineer with hands-on experience in  
AI services, web based backend engineering, and quant trading systems.  
  
I believe a BE developer's first clients are manager, designer and fellow developers.  
For bottleneck-free project progress, I always communicate proactively, verify, monitor, and respond quickly. 
I've been responsible for developing monitoring tools for fellow developers, productivity enhancement tools, and building easy-to-use CI/CD systems. 
I also manage the hiring process, onboarding, and pace-setting for backend developers joining the team, contributing to creating an organically functioning team.  

  
To provide stable services and [to become a good programmer](https://github.com/jujumilk3/to-become-a-better-programmer),  
I always study CS, OS, backend development, and software infrastructure (and also humanities and science fields).  

And I also like to write on various topics. You can read that posts by visiting my blog.  

Thank you.
