### Backend Engineer 

Hi, I'm a Python-focused backend engineer with hands-on experience in  
AI services, web based backend engineering, and quant trading systems.  
  
To ensure projects progress without bottlenecks, I always communicate proactively, verify, monitor, and respond quickly.
Following this approach, I've developed various tools including monitoring systems for fellow developers, productivity enhancement solutions, and easy-to-use CI/CD system.
I contribute to creating an organically functioning team by managing the recruitment process, onboarding, and serving as a pacesetter for all backend developers joining the team.
  
To provide stable services and [to become a good programmer](https://github.com/jujumilk3/to-become-a-better-programmer), I always study CS, OS, backend development, and software infrastructure (and also humanities and science fields). And sometimes I work 100hr/week.  

Additionally, I like to write on various topics. You can read those posts by visiting my blog.

Thank you, and if you have any questions or proposals, please email me.
